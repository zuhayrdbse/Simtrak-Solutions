## Welcome to the Storewise Tech Screening Challenge

### Setup Instructions
- Clone this repository
- Open the `index.html` file in your browser (eg: Google Chrome)


### Challenge Instructions

When we open the `index.html` file in the browser, we see two buttons and a list of some numbers.
Currently the buttons don't do anything but we would want them to perform the action mentioned on them.

So, clicking on the `Sort` button should sort those numbers on the list 
and clicking on the `Filter Odd Numbers` should only show the odd numbers from that list

That's all folks.

### Submitting your challenge

There are multiple ways that you can submit the challenge.
1. send us the updated `index.html` file
2. send us a zipped version of the directory
3. Fork the repo and send us a link after you have made your changes



### How we score

- 50 points for the correct working of the `Sort` button
- 50 points for the correct working of the `Filter` button

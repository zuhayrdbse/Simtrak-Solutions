## Overview

Made the code more professional by seperating the content from HTML to a different CSS and Javascript file. Implemented a reset button along with the task of implementing a working "Sort" and "Filter Odd Numbers" button. The reset button was implemented so as to get the initial values back again after filtering for odd numbers.
